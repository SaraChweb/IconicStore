cannot be said about cheap replicas, imitations diminished in nature from counterfeit sources. There is no substitute
for real Louis Vuitton fashion, online or in person. A Louis Vuitton original does not compromise on quality, be it a

Louis Vuitton vigorously and systematically protects the exclusive right to use its registered trademarks by taking
legal actions worldwide. Louis Vuitton has a zero tolerance policy against counterfeiting and is fully committed to
upholding the integrity of its exceptional brand in order to protect its customers' loyalty. <br> <br>

You should also note that Louis Vuitton never discounts its products. Louis Vuitton items advertised as discounted on
the Web are invariably fake. <br>

Louis arrived in a thriving city in the midst of industrialization. Trains were becoming the preferred means of
transportation for people. And with frequent travelers came the need for more durable travel pieces which could both
protect travelers’ belongings and withstand longer journeys. <br> <br>

Thus the young Louis started apprenticing for Monsieur Maréchal, a successful box-maker and packer. <br> <br>

Under the guidance of the trunk-master, Louis became a valued craftsman and seventeen years later, he opened his own
shop in Paris — he was 33. <br> <br>

He soon introduced his first innovation. At the time, trunks had rounded tops to allow for water to run off. The
downturn — stowage was inconvenient. He introduced the flat-top trunk which was easily stacked. He also made the trunks
waterproof by using leather.
