Guess is a high-end fashion brand that offers clothing, shoes, handbags, and other accessories for men and women. The
brand is best known for its trendy and stylish designs. While Guess is not a luxury brand, it's important to remember
that prices vary significantly from one item to the next.

In conclusion, while Guess may be a high-quality fashion brand, it only meets some criteria that define a luxury brand.
The company's affordable prices, wide availability, and relatively short history make it more of a high-end fashion
brand than a true luxury brand.
