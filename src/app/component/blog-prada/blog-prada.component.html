In the 80s, Prada and Bertelli introduced a womenswear line that was blazoned with low waistlines and narrow 
belts. It was a huge success and launched Prada to become the well-known name it is today.

Prada began gaining popularity in 1985, when she unveiled a series of black nylon handbags and backpacks with
understated labelingâ€”a stark contrast to the logo heavy clothes that dominated the fashion world at the time.

Prada doesn't rely on iconic logos like other luxury fashion houses. Instead of making its pieces recognisable with a
certain symbol or design, the brand focuses on staying true to its unique aesthetic. This understated and self-assured
approach to design is one of the reasons why Prada has been so successful.
